# Frontend Excellence Skill

Ensures the MapRecruit interface achieves a "WOW" factor through visual excellence and smooth interactions.

## When to use this skill

- When building customer-facing dashboards or landing pages.
- When implementing complex UI transitions or animations.
- When refining existing layouts for a more premium feel.

## How to use it

### 1. Aesthetic Design
- **Cohesive Themes**: Go beyond basic colors. Use HSL values for curated, harmonious palettes that feel tailored.
- **Visual Depth**: Use subtle gradients, soft shadows (`shadow-sm` to `shadow-xl`), and glassmorphism (backdrop-blur) to create layers.
- **Typography**: Leverage premium font pairings and careful whitespace (leading/tracking) for a high-end editorial feel.

### 2. Micro-Animations
- **Smooth Transitions**: Apply `transition-all` with custom cubic-bezier timing functions for more natural movement than standard ease.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Add subtle scale or hover effects to buttons and cards (`hover:scale-[1.02]`).
- **Loading States**: Use custom-engineered skeleton loaders that mimic the actual data structure to reduce perceived wait time.

### 3. Layout Perfection
- **Balanced Grids**: Ensure all components align to a 4px or 8px grid system.
- **Responsive Fluidity**: Use fluid typography and containers that scale perfectly from 320px to 2560px.
